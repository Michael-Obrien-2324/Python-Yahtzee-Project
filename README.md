# Python-Yahtzee-Project

This was an individual class project to create the game "Yahtzee" in python. The aim of the project was to demonstrate ability to use loops, variables, and if statements to create a playable remake of the game. Therefore, many shortcuts for loops and faster coding strategies were prohibited so that true exhibition of targeted coding skills would be presented accurately.

This Yahzee game is multiplayer and works just like the real game, with players taking turns rolling dice and scoring each round. The program displays players' scoreboard each turn for user convinience. The Menu function accesses current rankings, instructions, and the option to end game. Program will automatically mention whose turn it is and rolls dice randomly for accurate representation of the game. Chosen dice can be rerolled and are scored in players choice of scoreboard. The winner, along with rankings and scores are automatically annnounced at the conclusion of the game.
